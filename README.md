# SOC_RothC
This repo holds all important scripts for SOC modeling with RothC in R using the SoilR package.

It is still work in progress and should be used carefully. 

Paths have to be edited according to own working directory.

Scripts only run with EJPSoil database excel sheet and ERA5 monthly climate data as input files!
> Ask author for input files.
